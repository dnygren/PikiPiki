Installation instructions for PikiPiki
$Id: INSTALL,v 1.2 2000/02/17 05:38:07 mbp Exp $

For simplicity, all of the configurable settings for PikiPiki are in
the CGI script itself.  The installation procedure is:

 1. Make sure you have a web server that will let you run CGIs

 2. Make sure Python 1.5.2 is installed
  
 3. Configure the script

    a) On Unix, set the first line to refer to the location of your
       Python program.  For example,

       #! /usr/local/bin/python

       or for Apache on Windows, something like

       #! c:/python/python.exe

    b) On IIS, rename the script to piki.py and associate .py with
       Python.

    c) Set `data_dir' to the directory that will hold the page files.
       It is a serious security hole to put them in a directory containing
       CGIs or other files.

    d) If you wish, set the logfile names.

    e) Copy the default pages into data_dir/text.

    f) Copy the icon pikipiki-logo.png to an appropriate directory on the 
       web server, and make logo_string point to it.

    g) Fiddle with other things to adjust the appearance if you wish.

 4. Go.
