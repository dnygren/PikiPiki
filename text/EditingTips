Names of wiki pages have to be surrounded by two sets of opposing square brackets when in the Edit Text screen
{{{
[[like this]]
}}}
which will create a link to a wiki page [[like this]]. The wiki word will be highlighted if it is empty.

These are called called Wiki Words.

Piki Piki also supports the deprecated CamelCase method of creating WikiWords.

You can link to external sites by simply writing the URL: http://localhost/~nygren or by
[[http://127.0.0.1/~nygren|Making a URL linkname]]

You can also link to internal or external images via a URL:\\
Unix:\\
{{http://127.0.0.1/~nygren/index/Template/Images/A141_A196_A211.png |Starcat PSU Bar Chart}}\\
Windows:\\
{{http://127.0.0.1/CGI-BIN/Images/A141_A196_A211.png |Starcat PSU Bar Chart}}

or by direct reference:\\
Unix:\\
{{/~nygren/index/Template/CGI-BIN/Images/A196_droop.png|A196/A141 PSU Voltage Droop}}\\
Windows:\\
{{/CGI-BIN/Images/A196_droop.png|A196/A141 PSU Voltage Droop}}



Be aware that PikiPiki **does not lock pages during editing**, so if you pause for a long time on the edit screen you may overwrite somebody else's changes.

Leave blank lines between paragraphs.

To write in //italics//, enclose the text in double slashes.
To write **bold**, enclose the text in double asterisks.
You can also write **//bolditalic//** or the same as //**italicbold**//.

Piki Piki also supports the deprecated double single quotes method of creating ''italics'' and triple single quotes method of creating '''bold''' text.

If you can't figure out how to do this, click Edit Text in the footer to look at the source for this page.

You can also force a\\linebreak.
----

Learn about HorizontalRules like those that surround this sentence.

==You can make really big headings

=== Or smaller headings

==== Or even smaller headings ====

==== Headings can have asymmetrical equals signs

==== Or balanced symmetrical equals signs ====

----

Piki Piki supports simple tables:

|= Table Header title  |= Another header title |= Yet another table header |
| Table Row                   | table data |
| //Table Row 2//                 | **table data** |      tabledata |

----

If you indent text

  like this, then it is indented in the output

    you can have multiple levels of indent

And if you put asterisks at the start of the line

  * you get a 
  * bulleted
  * list
  ** which can also be indented
  *** to several levels


To insert program source without reformatting in pre-formatted "verbatim" mode with a monospace font, use three curly braces:

{{{
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    out.println("Hello");
  }
}}}

Just like that.

Now click **Edit Text** in the footer to see the markup for this page, and try it yourself in PikiSandBox.
