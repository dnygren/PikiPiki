Simple tables can be formatted like this:

|= Table header title               |= Another header title     |
| Table data | More table data  |
| Feature A | Supported in ECO 1 |
| Feature B | See Bug 12345 |
| //italic text is supported//             | ** bold text is also supported **     |

You can also format by forcing linebreaks:

My contact information:\\
Bldg: ABC \\
Room: 123\\
Phone: xyz\\
Mobile: abc\\

URLs can be directly written:

http://www.bing.com

or written referencing a title:

[[http://www.google.com|Google]]

Windows:\\
{{http://127.0.0.1/CGI-BIN/Images/A141_A196_A211.png |Starcat PSU Bar Chart}}

or if you do have access to the filesystem, by direct reference:\\
Unix:\\
{{/~dnygren/index/Template/CGI-BIN/Images/A196_droop.png|A196/A141 PSU Voltage Droop}}\\
Windows:\\
{{/CGI-BIN/Images/A196_droop.png|A196/A141 PSU Voltage Droop}}
